# Applied Programming
This repo includes three 2-4 week projects that I completed in my Applied Programming class. Below are short descriptions of each of the project.
- Sprint 1: Pulling stock market data from an API using python.
- Sprint 2&3: Created a Django app and database for getting and saving stock data from the API used in Sprint 1.
- Sprint 4: Tracking stats for my intermural basketball team and doing some data analysis on said stats with pandas.
