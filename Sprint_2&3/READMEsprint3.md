# Overview

I used this project as an opportunity to learn more about relational databases and specifically how they work in the Django web framework

I wrote a Django web app previously and I wanted to add a SQLite database in order to store stock data. This work will lay a foundation for future work on the app.

I wrote this software in order to learn how to work with relational database and to make progress on my stock trading bot.

# Relational Database

I am useing a SQLite database in Django.

I only have one database table a the moment and it's a table to hold stocks and thier ask and bid prices. The table also includes a field for whether or not the user owns the stock.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and Github to edit and manage my code.

I also used Django, Python, SQLite, HTML, and the yfinance library.
